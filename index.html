	    It is retargetable, meaning it can be ported to other FPGA
	    architectures easily, uses timing-driven algorithms, provides a python scripting API, supports complex
	    placement and floorplanning constraints, and has a nice GUI. Python and GUI support are optional, which
	    may be useful when deploying nextpnr on an embedded platform.

	    details of Xilinx 7-Series FPGAs. This family of devices is considerably more featureful and, correspondingly,
	    more complicated than previously documented families. Through perseverance and a little luck, enough has been
	    learned to configure logic cells and rewrite bitstreams.

            The abstraction level of the hardware description API is close to VHDL/Verilog, but by mixing it with the general purpose

            Software initialization for System-On-Chip designsis essential and it must be optimal,
            fast and flexible furtherbe able to manage future updates in a proper way. This
            work presents a hardware bootloader for the<a href="https://openrisc.io"
            target="_blank">OpenRISC</a> processor where processor code is sent from a central code
            repository server and received through an ESP8266 WiFi module. A custom hardware module
            loads the code directly into system’s memory before booting the processor. This approach
            allows maximum wireless reconfiguration flexibility for a large number of distributed
            embedded systems, as needed by the IoT and related technologies.

            Over the last year much effort has been put into the specification and the implementation.
            New concepts (such as subnets) have been introduced, the software implementation has been fully
            rewritten and is now more robust than ever, and the hardware has gained significant test coverage
            (and bug fixing). In addition, run-control debugging is being worked on as part of Google Summer of Code.
          </p>
          <p>
            This talk gives a quick overview over the Open SoC Debug architecture, and then dives into what changed
            over the last year.

            For as long as he could type, <a href="https://www.philipp-wagner.com/" target="_blank">Philipp</a>
            has been interested in software development. Being a real
            'full stack' developer, his interests range from hardware design to web development. Making
            things easier to understand is a recurrent theme in his work. As developer of the
            <a href="https://librecores.org" target="_blank">LibreCores</a>
            web site, he works on making digital hardware projects more discoverable. And by adding debug
            and trace support to SoCs, software development becomes easier on these devices.

            the last year finding a suitable "IP Cores" (or LibreCores, as we like to call them) has
            gotten even easier and faster. With the introduction of the new search and categorization features
            to LibreCores developers can easily browse through similar cores, filter them and ultimately get
            their project done faster.

            </a>Lessons learned while formally verifying the ZipCPU</h4>
          <p>
            The <a href="http://zipcpu.com/" target="_blank">ZipCPU</a> is a three-year old CPU and ISA designed for
            low logic FPGA's.  One of the challenges
            of any CPU design, to include the ZipCPU, is coming up with a sufficiently robust test suite to exercise
            all of the possible logic flows within the CPU.  While formal methods can be used for this task, they are
            traditionally viewed as too computationally expensive to formally verify something as complex as a CPU.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contrary to this view, the ZipCPU has now been formally verified
            using <a href="http://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"
            target="_blank">SymbiYosys</a>. As a result, many bugs have been found and fixed--bugs
            not found previously using canned test cases.  Not only that, it has also become easier
            to modify the CPU as necessary to achieve lower logic utilization, knowing that the
            formal solver will find any bugs in the updated implementations.

            apprenticeship at <a href="http://chipcraft-ic.com/"target="_blank">ChipCraft</a> and
            successfully evaluated feasibility and implemented most of User-Level ISA and partly
            Privileged Architecture specification. Their work will be further continued to achieve
            full RISC-V compliance. Our future plans are to develop a low-power single stage RISC-V

          <p>
            <a href="http://www.clash-lang.org/" target="_blank">Clash</a> is an effort to build a compiler
            translating Haskell to Verilog and VHDL. It
            supports many of Haskell's incredibly powerful constructs, allowing it to reuse much of
            the existing ecosystem. Clash supports powerful type inference, an interactive REPL,
            simulation on any target supported by GHC, abstract data types, and higher-order
            functions. Many hardware features are supported or under active development, such as
            verilog co-simulation, multiple clock domains, and bidirectional ports.
          </p>

            target="_blank">Lattice ECP5 FPGAs</a>, which combined with

            full open source flow from Verilog source to a bitstream. These FPGAs contain up to 85k
            logic cells and a range of features including DSPs, multi-gigabit transceivers and
            advanced IO functionality; unlocking applications such as networking, software-defined
            radio, high-resolution video, and testing processors powerful enough to run Linux!
          </p>
          <p>
            The documentation includes core features including logic, RAM and IO tiles. Work
            continues on both more advanced features and developing a feature-complete open
            toolchain for the ECP5.
          </p>
          <p>
            This presentation will discuss what approach was taken and what tools had been developed
            to create useful bitstream documentation within the constraints of publicly available
            interfaces; a reflection on what I think worked well and what could have been improved,
            and how to start you on your way to documenting more FPGA architectures for open source
            tools - it’s not as scary as you might think!
          </p>
          <p>
            There will also be a live hardware demonstration of the SymbiFlow open source end-to-end
            flow for the ECP5.

            The open source <a href="https://renode.io" target="_blank">Renode simulation

            systems development by making it easy to build simulated but binary-compatible SoCs,
            boards and networks by assembling reusable and object-oriented models. The rapid growth
            of RISC-V has given a new boost to the framework, as open, configurable CPUs have been
            transforming the way ASICs and FPGAs are being perceived, designed and worked
            with. HW/SW co-development and simulation-driven workflows are more natural in an open
            ISA ecosystem, and with the associated rise of open IPs and tooling, the not-so-distant
            future looks very promising.

            (a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Focus+Hotel+Premium+Gda%C5%84sk,+Nad+Stawem,+Gda%C5%84sk,+Poland/Gda%C5%84sk+University+of+Technology,+Gabriela+Narutowicza+11%2F12,+80-233+Gda%C5%84sk,+Poland/@54.3777406,18.6018538,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x46fd74c06d9441b7:0xf249873b374e3df0!2m2!1d18.6046961!2d54.383439!1m5!1m1!1s0x46fd74905b613ac3:0x7d834113ccd9a883!2m2!1d18.6163277!2d54.3716751!3e2" target="_blank">25 minute walk to the conference</a>)
            has an offer of a special rate for ORConf visitors this year.
          </p>
          <p>
            To obtain the offer, go to <a href="http://www.focushotels.pl/wydarzenia,165.html" target="_blank">http://www.focushotels.pl/wydarzenia,165.html</a>, and click on the "<strong>Rezerwuj</strong>" button next to the ORConf logo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you see the date selection popup, click on "<strong>Switch to English</strong>" at the top which will make things easier for non-Polish speakers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, and crucially, you'll see a link reading "<strong>Enter Code</strong>" at the top of the window which should now say "Plan your stay". Click on "Enter Code" and enter <strong>ORCONF2018</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will then see the dates are limited to the dates surrounding ORConf.

          <h4><a name="hotelscom" class="anchor" href="#hotelscom"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hotels.com</h4>
          <p>
            There are <a href="https://www.hotels.com/search.do?resolved-location=CITY%3A1028414%3AUNKNOWN%3AUNKNOWN&destination-id=1028414&q-destination=Gdansk,%20Poland&q-check-in=2018-09-21&q-check-out=2018-09-23&q-rooms=1&q-room-0-adults=1&q-room-0-children=0" target="_blank">numerous options on Hotels.com</a>
            including <a href="https://www.hotels.com/ho340719/?q-check-out=2018-09-23&FPQ=2&q-check-in=2018-09-21&WOE=7&WOD=5&q-room-0-children=0&tab=description&JHR=2&q-room-0-adults=1&YGF=14&MGT=2&ZSX=0&SYE=3" target="_blank">Hotel Impresja</a>
            which appears to be about as far from the conference venue as Focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/gda%C5%84sk+University+of+Technology/@54.3740325,18.6253874,16.08z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x46fd749eb7d370dd:0x99f979cdf1c1cba9!8m2!3d54.3743873!4d18.6268432" target="_blank">train station for the University (Gdansk Politechnika)</a>
            which should mean that anyone staying closer to town within reach of a train station should be able to access the venue relatively easily without a taxi.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trains from Gdansk Central Station (Gdansk Glowny) run about every 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes, until about 10PM at night. So hotels near there would likely be fine as well.
