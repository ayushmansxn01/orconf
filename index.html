		Gdansk has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk_Lech_Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa_Airport" target="_blank">international airport</a> and is served by by both major and low-cost airlines, but usefully is a hub for both <a href="https://www.ryanair.com/sr/en/plan-trip/destinations/flights-to-gdansk" target="_blank">Ryanair</a> and <a href="https://wizzair.com/en-gb/flights/flights-to-gdansk" target="_blank">Wizzair</a>, making it a very affordable city to fly to from most of Europe.
              </p>
	      <p class="card-text">
		There is a rail line from the aiport into the city which should make transferring from the aiport to accommodation pretty easy. There are further details on this on the <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Gda%C5%84sk#Get_in" target="_blank">Wikitravel</a> page for Gdansk, from which most of this information is cribbed.

	      <p class="card-text">
		Gdansk is also very accessible by rail from all of Europe
              </p>
              <h5>Accommodation</h5>
	      <p class="card-text">
		Below are some accommodation options for the conference.
              </p>
	      <h6>Focus Hotel</h6>
	      <p class="card-text">
		The Focus Hotel close to the Gdansk University of Technology

		has an offer of a special rate for ORConf visitors this year:
	      </p>

		<li>To obtain the offer, go to <a href="http://www.focushotels.pl/wydarzenia,165.html" target="_blank">http://www.focushotels.pl/wydarzenia,165.html</a>, and click on the "<strong>Rezerwuj</strong>" button next to the ORConf logo.</li>
		<li>Once you see the date selection popup, click on "<strong>Switch to English</strong>" at the top which will make things easier for non-Polish speakers.</li>
		<li>Next, and crucially, you'll see a link reading "<strong>Enter Code</strong>" at the top of the window which should now say "Plan your stay". Click on "Enter Code" and enter <strong>ORCONF2018</strong>.</li>
		<li>You will then see the dates are limited to the dates surrounding ORConf.</li>
	      </ul>
	      <h6>Hotels.com</h6>
	      <p class="card-text">
		There are <a href="https://www.hotels.com/search.do?resolved-location=CITY%3A1028414%3AUNKNOWN%3AUNKNOWN&destination-id=1028414&q-destination=Gdansk,%20Poland&q-check-in=2018-09-21&q-check-out=2018-09-23&q-rooms=1&q-room-0-adults=1&q-room-0-children=0" target="_blank">numerous options on Hotels.com</a>

		which appears to be about as far from the conference venue as Focus.
              </p>
	      <p class="card-text">
		There is a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/gda%C5%84sk+University+of+Technology/@54.3740325,18.6253874,16.08z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x46fd749eb7d370dd:0x99f979cdf1c1cba9!8m2!3d54.3743873!4d18.6268432" target="_blank">train station for the University (Gdansk Politechnika)</a> which should mean that anyone staying closer to town within reach of a train station should be able to access the venue relatively easily without a taxi.
              </p>
	      <p class="card-text">
		Trains from Gdansk Central Station (Gdansk Glowny) run about every 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes, until about 10PM at night. So hotels near there would likely be fine as well.

            <a href="https://opensocdebug.org/" target="_blank">Open SoC Debug</a> (OSD) is a complete solution
            for adding debug and trace to a SoC design. It consists of a solid specification, a software and a

            (to load your software into the chip), UART emulation, and much more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the last year much effort has been put into the specification and the implementation.
            New concepts (such as subnets) have been introduced, the software implementation has been fully
            rewritten and is now more robust than ever, and the hardware has gained significant test coverage
            (and bug fixing). In addition, run-control debugging is being worked on as part of Google Summer of Code.

          <p>
            The <a href="http://zipcpu.com/" target="_blank">ZipCPU</a> is a three-year old CPU and ISA designed for
            low logic FPGA's.  One of the challenges
            of any CPU design, to include the ZipCPU, is coming up with a sufficiently robust test suite to exercise
            all of the possible logic flows within the CPU.  While formal methods can be used for this task, they are
            traditionally viewed as too computationally expensive to formally verify something as complex as a CPU.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contrary to this view, the ZipCPU has now been formally verified
            using <a href="http://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"
            target="_blank">SymbiYosys</a>. As a result, many bugs have been found and fixed--bugs
            not found previously using canned test cases.  Not only that, it has also become easier
            to modify the CPU as necessary to achieve lower logic utilization, knowing that the
            formal solver will find any bugs in the updated implementations.

            course. Shortly after starting his studies abroad at Danmarks Tekniske Universitet, the
            creators founded QBayLogic; a company developing Clash and providing support for it in
            various forms. Right after graduating he joined the company and has been working there
            for a year. Since then, he's been an active contributor to the Clash compiler.

          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/SymbiFlow/prjtrellis" target="_blank">Project Trellis</a>
            documents the bitstream and low-level architecture
            of <a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/Products/FPGAandCPLD/ECP5"
            target="_blank">Lattice ECP5 FPGAs</a>, which combined with
            the <a href="https://github.com/SymbiFlow" target="_blank">SymbiFlow</a> tools enables a
            full open source flow from Verilog source to a bitstream. These FPGAs contain up to 85k
            logic cells and a range of features including DSPs, multi-gigabit transceivers and
            advanced IO functionality; unlocking applications such as networking, software-defined
            radio, high-resolution video, and testing processors powerful enough to run Linux!
          </p>
          <p>
            The documentation includes core features including logic, RAM and IO tiles. Work
            continues on both more advanced features and developing a feature-complete open
            toolchain for the ECP5.
          </p>
          <p>
            This presentation will discuss what approach was taken and what tools had been developed
            to create useful bitstream documentation within the constraints of publicly available
            interfaces; a reflection on what I think worked well and what could have been improved,
            and how to start you on your way to documenting more FPGA architectures for open source
            tools - it‚Äôs not as scary as you might think!
          </p>
          <p>
            There will also be a live hardware demonstration of the SymbiFlow open source end-to-end
            flow for the ECP5.

	  </h4>
          <p>
            The open source <a href="https://renode.io" target="_blank">Renode simulation
            framework</a> was created in order to enable a software-driven approach to embedded
            systems development by making it easy to build simulated but binary-compatible SoCs,
            boards and networks by assembling reusable and object-oriented models. The rapid growth
            of RISC-V has given a new boost to the framework, as open, configurable CPUs have been
            transforming the way ASICs and FPGAs are being perceived, designed and worked
            with. HW/SW co-development and simulation-driven workflows are more natural in an open
            ISA ecosystem, and with the associated rise of open IPs and tooling, the not-so-distant
            future looks very promising.

          <p>
	    We would like to introduce our Libre Silicon project, who we are, what we are doing and where we are now.
	    While a lot of projects are currently developing their own processors, mostly as open source in Verilog,
	    VHDL or even Chisel, we miss the free process afterwards to manufacture this chips.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The manufacturing is proprietary and has vendor lock-ins with triple NDAs - one for the
	    ""process development kit"" (PDK) , the technology itself; - one for the Standard Cell Library you can use
	    to synthesis your RTL; - and even another one for the details of all purchase commitments.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Our purpose is a free and open, community based silicon manufacturing process
	    (<a href="https://github.com/libresilicon/process" target="_blank">GitHub link</a>) without
	    any NDAs, a Standard Cell Library (<a href="https://github.com/chipforge/StdCellLib" blank="_blank">GitHub link</a>)
	      not only for that process as well as the a suitable, refurbished, new-written open source tool chain
	      (<a href="https://github.com/leviathanch/qtflow" target="_blank">qtflow</a>).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    During the last couple of month we already developed a first 1um process and are now close to manufacturing
	    a first test waver (<a href="https://github.com/chipforge/PearlRiver" target="_blank">GitHub link</a>). Well,
	    1um does not sounds very ambitious, but this process node is still quite well documented in textbooks,
	    robust and 5 Volt-tolerant. Once we got this, the machinery park in the clean room allows us to shrink down to 500nm.
