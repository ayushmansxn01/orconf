                    This year we're offering lightning talk and 15-minute speaking slots, with the choice of opting in to be considered for an extended slot of 30-40 minutes. We are intentionally reducing the standard speaking slot length this year to ensure we can accomodate all of the exceptional talk submissions we recieve, and to maximise face-to-face time throughout the event. We encourage speakers to skip the technical deep-dive presentations and instead provide high-level introductions and overviews of what makes their work great, and prepare a poster or hardware demo for people to come and discuss details during the breaks.

            <a name="nextpnr" href="#nextpnr"></a>Taking nextpnr to the next level!</h4>
              <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr" target="_blank">nextpnr</a>, a
                next-generation multi-architecture FPGA place-and-route tool was presented at
                <a href="https://orconf.org/2018/#symbioticeda" target="_blank">ORConf 2018</a>
                with both iCE40 and highly experimental ECP5 support. Over the past year, we have taken the
                ECP5 support from proof-of-concept to production-ready, and opened up the possibility to use nextpnr
                to build large and complex designs. This has included augmenting the existing simulated annealing
                placer with a significantly faster analytical placer (HeAP), adding multi-threaded timing analysis,
                and adding support for the nitty-gritty hardware details needed for high-speed IO interfaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                The end result is the capability to build large designs quickly, such as
                Linux-capable <a href="https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv"
                                 target="_blank">VexRiscv</a> and

                processors with DDR3 memory and Gigabit Ethernet. A live demo of this
                collaborative open gateware and toolchain project will be given.
              </p>
              <p>
                This talk will introduce some of the improvements made to nextpnr, as well as a
                roadmap to improved support for even bigger and better FPGAs in the future – and how
                you can get involved!

            <a name="modelcheckers" href="#modelcheckers"></a>Open-source model checkers: ready for industry?</h4>
              <p>
                Open source penetrates the microelectronics design, making hardware development more accessible. 
                To leverage this effect, one needs open CAD tools, including formal verification facilities. 
                The talk is concentrated on an experimental comparison of several open-source model checkers 
                for Verilog modules on open benchmarks. For selected tools Verilog support and property checking
                facilities were evaluated on typical designs and industrial-scale modules. This talk also 
                briefly describes <a href="https://forge.ispras.ru/projects/retrascope"
                                     target="_blank">Retrascope</a>
                - a new open-source model checker that verifies Verilog descriptions
                against SVA properties. The toolkit allows analyzing of HDL descriptions, 
                reconstructing and visualization of the underlying models and using the derived models 
                for test generation and property checking.

              <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/bobbl/rudolv/" target="_blank">RudolV</a> is yet another
                5-stage in-order RISC-V core. In contrast to other
                implementations it focuses on timing predictability by avoiding speculative
                components like out-of-order execution, dynamic branch prediction or caches.
                Without affecting the predictability, techniques like instruction fusion, 
                in-order dual issue and decoupled fetching can improve its throughput.

            <a name="netlistpaths" href="#netlistpaths"></a>netlist-paths: A command line tool for querying paths in a Verilog design</h4>
              <p>
                In a complex Verilog design, it can be difficult to relate timing reports for
                critical paths back to the the source code because of the way a design is flattened
                and optimised in a physical design flow. Being able to quickly correspond a timing
                path to the source code is useful in determining causes and potential fixes. This
                talk describes <a href="https://github.com/jameshanlon/netlist-paths"
                target="_blank">a simple command-line tool</a> to do this. It uses a modified
                version of
                Verilator to obtain a netlist from Verilog source code and provides options to query
                paths and cones of logic by specifying start, end and through points in the design,
                similar to what you find with EDA tooling.

            <a name="poke" href="#poke"></a>GNU poke, an extensible editor for structured binary data</h4>
              <p>
                GNU poke is a new interactive editor for binary data.  Not limited to editing basic
                entities such as bits and bytes, it provides a full-fledged procedural, interactive
                programming language designed to describe data structures and to operate on them.
              </p>
              <p>
                GNU poke is useful in many domains.  It is very well suited to aid in the
                development of programs that operate on binary files, such as assemblers and
                linkers. It is also good for the fast development of prototypes for programs like
              linkers,
                compressors or filters, and it provides a convenient foundation to write other
                utilities such as diff and patch tools for binary files.  I reckon GNU poke could be
                useful for people working on the software stack for open source hardware systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                First I will introduce the program and show what it does: from simple bits/bytes
                editing to user-defined structures and then, very very quickly due to time
                limitations,  will cover how to describe user data, which is to say the art of
                writing "pickles".

                The Chips4Maker service was first brought forward on ORConf two years ago. At that

            <a name="idealhdl" href="#idealhdl"></a>On a quest for the ideal HDL(s) for makers and hobbyists</h4>
              <p>
                With a software background I stumbled in the hardware 'programming' languages beginning of this decade.
                Since the beginning I had a love/hate relationship with the common RTL languages at best. In the
                beginning I thought it was just the normal rookie feeling and some persistence would
                solve it. After almost a decade I am convinced some fundamental shortcomings in the
                common RTL languages are holding back hardware development productivity and the
                usability by non-experts like makers.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is hope though, as I will also highlight some recent developments which in my
                opinion are a big step in the right direction.

              <p>
                Encrypted Verilog is unusable to open source tools like
                <a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator" target="_blank">Verilator</a>. Beyond that, the
                Verilog encryption scheme is basically worthless. See

                details. Or if you prefer more practical evidence, spend a little while researching
                actual attacks on encrypted RTL.

                a protected Verilog module into a DPI-accessible shared object. While the compiled
                object could be analyzed, this approach provides little to no opportunity for the
                plaintext Verilog to be exposed.
