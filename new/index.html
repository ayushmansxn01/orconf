          <p>
	    <a href="https://github.com/SymbiFlow/nextpnr" target="_blank">nextpnr</a> is a retargetable FOSS FPGA
	    place-and-route tool that is replacing arachne-pnr as place-and-route
	    tool in the <a href="http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/" target="_blank">IceStorm</a> open source
	    <a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/Products/FPGAandCPLD/iCE40" target="_blank">iCE40</a> flow.
	    It is retargetable, meaning it can be ported to other FPGA
	    architectures easily, uses timing-driven algorithms, provides a python scripting API, supports complex
	    placement and floorplanning constraints, and has a nice GUI. Python and GUI support are optional, which
	    may be useful when deploying nextpnr on an embedded platform.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This presentation covers nextpnr from a user perspective, but also gives a few pointers for
	    how to port nextpnr to new FPGA architectures.

            <a href="https://opensocdebug.org/" target="_blank">Open SoC Debug</a> (OSD) is a complete solution
            for adding debug and trace to a SoC design. It consists of a solid specification, a software and a
            hardware implementation and supports tracing of CPU cores (RISC-V and OpenRISC currently), memory access
            (to load your software into the chip), UART emulation, and much more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the last year much effort has been put into the specification and the implementation.
            New concepts (such as subnets) have been introduced, the software implementation has been fully
            rewritten and is now more robust than ever, and the hardware has gained significant test coverage
            (and bug fixing). In addition, run-control debugging is being worked on as part of Google Summer of Code.

          <p>
            The <a href="http://zipcpu.com/" target="_blank">ZipCPU</a> is a three-year old CPU and ISA designed for
            low logic FPGA's.  One of the challenges
            of any CPU design, to include the ZipCPU, is coming up with a sufficiently robust test suite to exercise
            all of the possible logic flows within the CPU.  While formal methods can be used for this task, they are
            traditionally viewed as too computationally expensive to formally verify something as complex as a CPU.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contrary to this view, the ZipCPU has now been formally verified
            using <a href="http://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"
            target="_blank">SymbiYosys</a>. As a result, many bugs have been found and fixed--bugs
            not found previously using canned test cases.  Not only that, it has also become easier
            to modify the CPU as necessary to achieve lower logic utilization, knowing that the
            formal solver will find any bugs in the updated implementations.

	    Bluetooth combo chips. He's based in the WLAN ASIC team and has worked on a wide variety of projects including baseband phy
	    implementations, SOC IP integration, ARM-based CPU subsystem design, AXI/AHB/APB backplane designs,
	    block and chip level design verification, radio modeling, silicon implementation, version control
	    and continuous integration.

	    He became interested in cocotb after a less than compelling experience with UVM and Verilog/SystemVerilog in general.
	    He got Broadcom to sponsor a number of new features and bug fixes. He continues to use cocotb on a daily basis and
	    evangelizes its use inside Broadcom.

          <p>
	    Why is functional verification world dominated by UVM? Are UVM users happy with tools and methodology? Does a
	    digital verification really require a digital IC design background?
	    I will try to address modern verification problems and answer why <a href="https://github.com/potentialventures/cocotb"
										 target="_blank">Cocotb</a>-based approach can
	    be a solid alternative to modern flow. I will explain what are the limitations and how Cocotb can be improved to
	    become a comprehensive functional verification platform. Metric-driven verification extensions to Cocotb will be
	    presented as a step towards this goal.

          <p>
	    We would like to introduce our Libre Silicon project, who we are, what we are doing and where we are now.
	    While a lot of projects are currently developing their own processors, mostly as open source in Verilog,
	    VHDL or even Chisel, we miss the free process afterwards to manufacture this chips.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The manufacturing is proprietary and has vendor lock-ins with triple NDAs - one for the
	    ""process development kit"" (PDK) , the technology itself; - one for the Standard Cell Library you can use
	    to synthesis your RTL; - and even another one for the details of all purchase commitments.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Our purpose is a free and open, community based silicon manufacturing process
	    (<a href="https://github.com/libresilicon/process" target="_blank">GitHub link</a>) without
	    any NDAs, a Standard Cell Library (<a href="https://github.com/chipforge/StdCellLib" blank="_blank">GitHub link</a>)
	      not only for that process as well as the a suitable, refurbished, new-written open source tool chain
	      (<a href="https://github.com/leviathanch/qtflow" target="_blank">qtflow</a>).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    During the last couple of month we already developed a first 1um process and are now close to manufacturing
	    a first test waver (<a href="https://github.com/chipforge/PearlRiver" target="_blank">GitHub link</a>). Well,
	    1um does not sounds very ambitious, but this process node is still quite well documented in textbooks,
	    robust and 5 Volt-tolerant. Once we got this, the machinery park in the clean room allows us to shrink down to 500nm.
