At the literal heart of that technology sits a silicon core, combined with general and specific instructions and connections. The insane cost, risk, development time, necessary volumes, and limited computing demands kept the lucrative chip opportunity within reach of just a handful of companies -- focused mostly on general purpose processors. New computing needs in various power and performance dimensions have increased demand and competition for custom processors. This pressure is quietly and rapidly disrupting the processor industry. An Open source approach to processors now reduces risk and investment, with accelerated time to market, and opens the opportunity to thousands of possible custom processors.

The two communicate with each other using a very simple text based serial protocol.\n\nGDB has long been served by a number of debug server options, for Linux class systems the gdbserver application provides this functionality, and for embedded systems the gdbserver built into OpenOCD is commonly used, but support for some targets (such as RTL simulation) we can do better.

    "category": "sat",
    "abstract": "In June we announced Embench\u2122 (for Embedded Benchmark), a benchmark for embedded IoT devices created by experts from both academia and industry. We first looked at past benchmark efforts to try to incorporate their good ideas and to avoid their mistakes, and drew the following seven lessons:\nEmbench must be free (no cost).     Embench must be easy to port and run.     Embench must be a suite of real programs.     Embench must have a supporting organization that maintains its relevance over time.     Embench must report a single summarizing performance score.     Embench should report geometric mean and standard deviation as the summarizing score.     Embench must involve both academia and industry.\n\nOur plan is to follow \u201cAgile Benchmark Development\u201d by bringing out an initial 0.5 version for evaluation and feedback, with a 1.0 version to be released after a few iterations of preliminary Embench versions (0.5, 0.6, 0.7,...) to debug both the suite and the ground rules. We initially aim to evaluate microcontrollers that support \u226464KiB of code and read only data\u2014which would typically be stored in Flash or ROM\u2014and \u226416KiB of data.\n\nIn this talk we describe Embench 0.5. Unlike the popular Dhrystone and CoreMark benchmarks that are single synthetic programs, Embench 0.5 suite has 20 real programs. They do little or no floating point computation, but some are branch intensive, some memory intensive, and some integer compute intensive. Like SPEC, the single performance number that people will promote is the geometric mean of performance relative to a reference platform of the 20 programs plus the geometric standard deviation to indicate the significance of differences between processors. Novel features of Embench include reporting code size as well as program performance and to measure interrupt latency and context switching. These novel features play an important role in embedded computing but have not yet appeared in embedded benchmarks. The Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) Foundation organization is the official sponsor of Embench. The Embench organizing committee now has more than 10 volunteers to evolve the benchmark.\n\nIn addition to announcing Embench 0.5, we will demonstrate its value by contrasting its performance evaluation of several embedded systems to Dhrystone and CoreMark.\n\nOur hope is that henceforth is that publications of performance for embedded computers will include Embench along with Dhrystone and CoreMark, and that Embench will eventually retire these much older, single, synthetic benchmarks to the dustbin of history.\nPresenter: Jeremy Bennett\n\nJeremy Bennett is Vice-chair and convener of the Embench working group, which is developing a new set of benchmarks for Embedded systems.\n"

    "category": "sat",
    "abstract": " In a complex Verilog design, it can be difficult to relate timing reports for critical paths back to the the source code because of the way a design is flattened and optimised in a physical design flow. Being able to quickly correspond a timing path to the source code is useful in determining causes and potential fixes. This talk describes a simple command-line tool to do this. It uses a modified version of Verilator to obtain a netlist from Verilog source code and provides options to query paths and cones of logic by specifying start, end and through points in the design, similar to what you find with EDA tooling.\n\nPresenter: Jamie Hanlon\n\nJamie Hanlon works as an Engineer at Graphcore in Bristol (UK), a company building silicon processors for machine intelligence. He is part of the Silicon team, working on the logical and physical design of the a processor, replicated thousands of time over the chip.

Hardware designers often work on close-source, expensive tool suites with only a small degree of freedom, to produce a suitable hardware prototype. Once low-level software produced (kernel, drivers...) from the hardware specification, software developers then use the prototype as a support for their developments and testing, with other tools. This long, sequential process could be dramatically shortened by using a unique collaborative tool, centered around a software representation of the hardware: a virtual platform.\n\nIn this talk, we will present Hiventive's multi-simulator virtual platform engine running a RISC-V virtual platform embedding a Linux distribution.
